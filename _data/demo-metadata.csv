Tremblay garnered critical acclaim for her material ingenuity, humor, and creative talents. For decades, she was embraced by Native American art and intellectual communities in New York City and Washington State where she taught poetry, creative writing, and art classes at Evergreen State College. This oversized Haudenosaunee style ""fancy basket"" uses innovative materials, including recycled 35mm filmstock and gold metallic thread, to demonstrate contemporary interpretations of traditional Northeastern Indigenous basketmaking techniques, specifically the porcupine stitch, curlicue, or thistle weave. Indicative of Tremblay’s complex woven compositions of layered imagery, the work cleverly addresses romanticized stereotypes of Native American peoples in film and popular culture by using recycled filmstrips of the motion picture WindWalker (1981).",baskets (containers),,,,2022.488,,image/jpeg,"Copyright Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In Edson's Flag, Watt, a member of the Seneca Nation, pays tribute to Indigenous warriors and war veterans, including her great-uncle Edson. She makes a unified piece from pieces that might not seem to fit easily together--a section of patchwork quilt, wool blankets evoking trade-goods (one army-green, one red), and an American flag.

The chief and other members of his tribe were in the capital to negotiate a treaty for the sale of their lands south of Lake Erie. By 1838, the Senecas’ removal from their remaining lands had been set out in the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, and the tribe was to remove to what is known today as Kansas.
